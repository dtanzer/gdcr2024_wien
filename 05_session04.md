Process/Increments

- Add some kind of (very small) test passing in some kind of way. (Cheating allowed)
- Once passing, replace fake implementations with real implementation, a little at a time.

## Test && commit || revert

- Run tests often
- Tests are green -> code is committed
- Tests failed -> code is reverted and goes back to green
