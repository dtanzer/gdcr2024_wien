<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-start;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="./images/mad-tea_ablauf.png" style="width: 100%" />
  </div>
  <div  style="text-align: left;">
    Let's build two circles: <br><br>
    - the inner circle looking outwards <br>
    - the outer circle looking inwards <br>
  </div>
</div>

## Finish The Sentences

The inner circle starts introducing him/herself \
by finishing two sentences:

- My name is [...], I am a [role].
- I am here today because [...] \
  and I will contribute [...].
- Optional: one random/fun fact about you.

---

## I'll Start

- My name is *Peter*, I am the *Code Cop* \
  (Technical Coach).
- I am here today because *I love Coderetreats* \
  and I will *try to create a learning environment*.
- My favourite programming language is Lisp &#x1f92f;

---

## Two Circles Now

- Let's stand in two circles.
- Both introduce themselves.
- Ask questions if there is time.
- Outer circle rotates to the right on signal.

*Let's go*

## The Sentences
