## Two Circles

Let's stand in two circles, \
the inner circle looking outwards, \
the outer circle looking inwards

One starts introducing him/herself \
by finishing two sentences:

---

## Finish The Sentences

- My name is [...], I am a [role].
- I am here today because [...] \
  and I will contribute [...].
- Optional: one random/fun fact about you.


---

## I'll Start

- My name is *Peter*, I am the *Code Cop* \
  (Technical Coach).
- I am here today because *I love Coderetreats* \
  and I will *try to create a learning environment*.
- My favourite programming language is Lisp &#x1f92f;

## Two Circles Now

- Let's stand in two circles.
- Both introduce themselves.
- Ask questions if there is time.
- Outer circle rotates to the right on signal.

*Let's go*
