### Tetris Details

- The seven tetrominoes are I, O, T, S, Z, L, and J.
- In the grid, usually 10 wide and 20 tall, tetrominoes fall from the top and are placed at the bottom.
- When a row is completely filled, it clears, causing the blocks above it to shift downward.
- Players control tetrominoes' horizontal movement and rotate them to fit better into spaces.
- The game ends when a new tetromino can no longer fit into the grid because the stack of blocks has reached the top.
