## Taking Baby Steps 👼

1. Setup version control, commit your setup.
1. Set a timer for 2 minutes when you start.
1. Write exactly one test. When the timer rings:
    * <span style="color:red;">test is red</span> => delete (revert) and restart.
    * <span style="color:green;">test is green</span> => continue (commit).
1. Restart timer and repeat from 2
    * no discussions in between timers
1. Use the same procedure for Refactoring!
