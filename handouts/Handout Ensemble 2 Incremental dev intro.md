# Ensemble Incremental development intro

## Goals of this Session

Make the smallest steps possible applying the quality criteria

- functional
- passes the tests
- provides feedback
- small
- usable
- valuable
- vertical over horizontal

Facilitator guides ensemble to smaller steps.

## Possible question to guide the ensemble

- what else can we leave out
- what is the smallest business value
- can I still play the game
- is it still usable
- does it fulfill the criteria of an increment

## Spoiler Alert - possible starting test cases

- one column / one row / tetromino appears
- one column / one row / tetromino disappears after tick
- ...

## Additional Complexity

- scoring
- more dimension
- tetromino falls
- tetromino moves left/right
- tetromino rotate left/right
- different tetrominoes shapes
- ...
