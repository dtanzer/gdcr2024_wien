# Ensemble, TDD and Kata Intro

## Goals of this Session

- Get to know Ensemble Programming
- Get to know Test Driven Development
- Get to know Tetris

Facilitator: Small Increments are out of scope in this session (don't even mention it)

## Ensemble

- Designated Typer (is not allowed to decide what to write)
- Designated Talker (decides what we are going to do)
- The Ensemble supports the Talker and throws in ideas
- We rotate every 5 minutes
- Typer and Talker call out their roles
- We treat each other with kindness, consideration and respect

Facilitator takes care of the functioning of the Ensemble.

## TDD

1. Write a failing test
2. Watch the test fail
3. Write the simplest code to make the test pass
4. Refactor
5. Go to 1.

Facilitator takes care that we follow the cycle.

## Tetris

- Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle where players manipulate falling blocks to complete horizontal lines on a vertical grid.
- The seven tetrominoes are I, O, T, S, Z, L, and J.
- In the grid, usually 10 wide and 20 tall, tetrominoes fall from the top and are placed at the bottom.
- When a row is completely filled, it clears, causing the blocks above it to shift downward.
- Players control tetrominoesâ€™ horizontal movement and rotate them to fit better into spaces.
- The game ends when a new tetromino can no longer fit into the grid because the stack of blocks has reached the top.
